# r = correlation_coeffient from sample
# n = n_samples (e.g. datapoints)
# BF10 = jzs_corbf(r,n)

# Interpretation:
#       >   100   Decisive evidence for H1
# 30    -   100   Very Strong evidence for H1
# 10    -   30    Strong evidence for H1
# 3     -   10    Substantial evidence for H1
# 1     -   3     Anecdotal evidence for H1
# 1               No evidence
# 1/3   -   1     Anecdotal evidence for H0
# 1/10  -  1/3    Substantial evidence for H0
# 1/30  -  1/10   Strong evidence for H0
# 1/100 -  1/30   Very Strong evidence for H0
#       <  1/100  Decisive evidence for H0
